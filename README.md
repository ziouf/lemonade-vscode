Lemonade allows you to use local LLMs on GitHub Copilot Chat!

1. Make sure [Lemonade](https://lemonade-server.ai/) is running
    * We recommend setting the context size to at least 32k by using the Lemonade tray or --ctx-size cli option.
1. Install the [Lemonade for GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lemonade-sdk.lemonade-sdk) extension
1. Open VS Code's chat interface, click the model picker, and click "Manage Models..."
1. Select "Lemonade" provider and choose a model (Qwen3-Coder-30B is a great start!)

You can now start chatting with your local LLM models! 🥳

> NOTE: If needed, configure a custom server URL using the "Manage Lemonade Provider" command
